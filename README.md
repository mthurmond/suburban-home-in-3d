# suburban-home-in-3d
I created a basic 3D model of a suburban home using Tinkercad. I imported the resulting .stl file into a slicer to prepare it for printing. The print was completed using a makesshift printer at Hack Manhattan's makerspace (https://hackmanhattan.com/) using black ABS plastic. I scaled the print job down to 0.7x original size to save print time.
